# email_validator

Sample Python code illustrating how to use [Pyparsing](http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/) to parse an email address, with an emphasis on decent error reporting.

## Usage

The tests are written for the most excellent [pytest](http://pytest.org/), which I like because of its natural and informative assertions. To run the tests:

    $ py.test
