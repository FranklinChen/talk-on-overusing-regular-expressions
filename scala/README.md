## Scala code for presentation "Stop Overusing Regular Expressions!"

To run the code, install [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/), then you're all set.

To run the SBT console:

```
$ sbt
```

Then run all the tests:

```
> test
```

Run the toy email validator (which does almost no checking):

```
> run "emailaddress"
```
